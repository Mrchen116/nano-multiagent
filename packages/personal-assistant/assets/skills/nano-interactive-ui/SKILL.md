# Interactive replies

Generated from the Nano nano-1 catalogue; use the current version unchanged.

Call send_message with target, an independently readable text summary, and interactive: {format: "openui", catalog_version: "nano-1", source: "..."}. Optionally set supersedes_message_id to replace your own prior card in the same conversation. Submit a complete program of at most 64 KiB. Other clients receive the summary. Simple answers need no card.

Users can edit fields privately, submit the visible ContinueButton, or attach their choices to handwritten text. Treat the handwritten text as the current request and the attached fields as data; preserve instructions such as “do not send yet”. A click records a user message, not a completed business action. Execute any actual sending/saving only through the normal tools and authority checks, then report its actual result. Cards are immutable; respond to revisions with a new card. After explicit delivery, end with the exact non-empty final text NO_REPLY. The host suppresses it after the confirmed card. Never end with an empty response.

Write an OpenUI program only inside send_message.interactive.source. The text argument remains a readable summary. These language instructions do not replace your normal tool-use or final-answer workflow.

## Syntax Rules

1. Each statement is on its own line: `identifier = Expression`
2. `root` is the entry point — every program must define `root = Stack(...)`
3. Expressions are: strings ("..."), numbers, booleans (true/false), null, arrays ([...]), objects ({...}), or component calls TypeName(arg1, arg2, ...)
4. Use references for readability: define `name = ...` on one line, then use `name` later
5. EVERY variable (except root) MUST be referenced by at least one other variable. Unreferenced variables are silently dropped and will NOT render. Always include defined variables in their parent's children/items array.
6. Arguments are POSITIONAL (order matters, not names). Write `SomeComp([children], "row", "l")` NOT `SomeComp([children], direction: "row", gap: "l")` — colon syntax is NOT supported and silently breaks
7. Optional arguments can be omitted from the end
8. Declare mutable state with `$varName = defaultValue`. Components marked with `$binding` can read/write these. Undeclared $variables are auto-created with null default.
9. String concatenation: `"text" + $var + "more"`
10. Dot member access: `query.field` reads a field; on arrays it extracts that field from every element
11. Index access: `arr[0]`, `data[index]`
12. Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, % (work on numbers; + is string concat when either side is a string)
13. Comparison: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
14. Logical: &&, ||, ! (prefix)
15. Ternary: `condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse`
16. Parentheses for grouping: `(a + b) * c`
- Strings use double quotes with backslash escaping

## Component Signatures

Arguments marked with ? are optional. Sub-components can be inline or referenced; prefer references for better streaming.
Props marked `$binding<type>` accept a `$variable` reference for two-way binding.

### Layout
Stack(children: any[], direction?: "row" | "column", gap?: "none" | "xs" | "s" | "m" | "l" | "xl" | "2xl", align?: "start" | "center" | "end" | "stretch" | "baseline", justify?: "start" | "center" | "end" | "between" | "around" | "evenly", wrap?: boolean) — Flex container. direction: "row"|"column" (default "column"). gap: "none"|"xs"|"s"|"m"|"l"|"xl"|"2xl" (default "m"). align: "start"|"center"|"end"|"stretch"|"baseline". justify: "start"|"center"|"end"|"between"|"around"|"evenly".
Separator(orientation?: "horizontal" | "vertical", decorative?: boolean) — Visual divider between content sections

### Content
Card(children: (TextContent | CardHeader | Separator | BarChart | LineChart | Table | Form | Stack | ContinueButton)[], variant?: "card" | "sunk" | "clear", direction?: "row" | "column", gap?: "none" | "xs" | "s" | "m" | "l" | "xl" | "2xl", align?: "start" | "center" | "end" | "stretch" | "baseline", justify?: "start" | "center" | "end" | "between" | "around" | "evenly", wrap?: boolean) — Styled container. variant: "card" (default, elevated) | "sunk" (recessed) | "clear" (transparent). Always full width. Accepts all Stack flex params (default: direction "column"). Cards flex to share space in row/wrap layouts.
CardHeader(title?: string, subtitle?: string) — Header with optional title and subtitle
TextContent(text: string, size?: "small" | "default" | "large" | "small-heavy" | "large-heavy") — Text block. Supports markdown. Optional size: "small" | "default" | "large" | "small-heavy" | "large-heavy".

### Tables
Table(columns: Col[]) — Data table — column-oriented. Each Col holds its own data array.
Col(label: string, data: any, type?: "string" | "number" | "action") — Column definition — holds label + data array

### Charts (2D)
BarChart(labels: string[], series: Series[], variant?: "grouped" | "stacked", xLabel?: string, yLabel?: string, height?: number) — Vertical bars; use for comparing values across categories with one or more series
LineChart(labels: string[], series: Series[], variant?: "linear" | "natural" | "step", xLabel?: string, yLabel?: string, height?: number) — Lines over categories; use for trends and continuous data over time
Series(category: string, values: number[]) — One data series

### Forms
Form(name: string, buttons: ContinueButton, fields?: FormControl[]) — A named group of labelled fields with one ContinueButton.
FormControl(label: string, input: Input | TextArea | Select | Slider | CheckBoxGroup | RadioGroup, hint?: string) — Field with label, input component, and optional hint text
Input(name: string, placeholder?: string, type?: "text" | "email" | "password" | "number" | "url", rules?: {required?: boolean, email?: boolean, url?: boolean, numeric?: boolean, min?: number, max?: number, minLength?: number, maxLength?: number, pattern?: string}, value?: $binding<string>)
TextArea(name: string, placeholder?: string, rows?: number, rules?: {required?: boolean, email?: boolean, url?: boolean, numeric?: boolean, min?: number, max?: number, minLength?: number, maxLength?: number, pattern?: string}, value?: $binding<string>)
Select(name: string, items: SelectItem[], placeholder?: string, rules?: {required?: boolean, email?: boolean, url?: boolean, numeric?: boolean, min?: number, max?: number, minLength?: number, maxLength?: number, pattern?: string}, value?: $binding<string>, size?: "small" | "medium" | "large")
SelectItem(value: string, label: string) — Option for Select
Slider(name: string, variant: "continuous" | "discrete", min: number, max: number, step?: number, defaultValue?: number[], label?: string, rules?: {required?: boolean, email?: boolean, url?: boolean, numeric?: boolean, min?: number, max?: number, minLength?: number, maxLength?: number, pattern?: string}, value?: $binding<number[]>) — Numeric slider input; supports continuous and discrete (stepped) variants
CheckBoxGroup(name: string, items: CheckBoxItem[], rules?: {required?: boolean, email?: boolean, url?: boolean, numeric?: boolean, min?: number, max?: number, minLength?: number, maxLength?: number, pattern?: string}, value?: $binding<Record<string, boolean>>)
CheckBoxItem(label: string, description: string, name: string, defaultChecked?: boolean)
RadioGroup(name: string, items: RadioItem[], defaultValue?: string, rules?: {required?: boolean, email?: boolean, url?: boolean, numeric?: boolean, min?: number, max?: number, minLength?: number, maxLength?: number, pattern?: string}, value?: $binding<string>)
RadioItem(label: string, description: string, value: string)

### Other
ContinueButton(id: string, label: string) — Submit the visible label and current choices as a new user message. Use a unique static id and a clear static label naming the intended next step.

## Built-in Functions

Data functions prefixed with `@` to distinguish from components. These are the ONLY functions available — do NOT invent new ones.
Use @-prefixed built-in functions (@Count, @Sum, @Avg, @Min, @Max, @Round) on data. Do NOT hardcode computed values.

@Count(array: any[]) → number — Returns array length
@First(array: any[]) → any — Returns first element of array
@Last(array: any[]) → any — Returns last element of array
@Sum(numbers: number[]) → number — Sum of numeric array
@Avg(numbers: number[]) → number — Average of numeric array
@Min(numbers: number[]) → number — Minimum value in array
@Max(numbers: number[]) → number — Maximum value in array
@Sort(array: any[], field: string, direction?: "asc" | "desc") → any[] — Sort array by field. Direction: "asc" (default) or "desc"
@Filter(array: any[], field: string, operator: "==" | "!=" | ">" | "<" | ">=" | "<=" | "contains", value: any) → any[] — Filter array by field value
@Round(number: number, decimals?: number) → number — Round to N decimal places (default 0)
@Abs(number: number) → number — Absolute value
@Floor(number: number) → number — Round down to nearest integer
@Ceil(number: number) → number — Round up to nearest integer
@Each(array: any[], varName: string, template: any) — Evaluate template for each element. varName is the loop variable — use it ONLY inside the template expression (inline). Do NOT create a separate statement for the template.

Builtins compose — output of one is input to the next:
`@Count(@Filter(data.rows, "field", "==", "val"))` for KPIs/chart values, `@Round(@Avg(data.rows.score), 1)`, `@Each(data.rows, "item", Comp(item.field))` for per-item rendering.
Array pluck: `data.rows.field` extracts a field from every row → use with @Sum, @Avg, charts, tables.

IMPORTANT @Each rule: The loop variable (e.g. "item") is ONLY available inside the @Each template expression. Always inline the template — do NOT extract it to a separate statement.
CORRECT: `list = @Each(rows, "t", Comp(t.name))`
WRONG: `item = Comp(t.name)` then `list = @Each(rows, "t", item)`, because t is undefined in item.

## Hoisting & Streaming (CRITICAL)

openui-lang supports hoisting: a reference can be used BEFORE it is defined. The parser resolves all references after the full input is parsed.

During streaming, the output is re-parsed on every chunk. Undefined references are temporarily unresolved and appear once their definitions stream in. This creates a progressive top-down reveal — structure first, then data fills in.

**Recommended statement order for optimal streaming:**
1. `root = Stack(...)` — UI shell appears immediately
2. $variable declarations — state ready for bindings
3. Component definitions — fill in with data already available
4. Data values — leaf content last

Always write the root = Stack(...) statement first so the UI shell appears immediately, even before child data has streamed in.
## Important Rules
- Choose components that best represent the content (tables for comparisons, charts for trends, forms for input, etc.)

## Final Verification
Before finishing, walk your output and verify:
1. root = Stack(...) is the FIRST line (for optimal streaming).
2. Every referenced name is defined. Every defined name (other than root) is reachable from root.
3. Every $binding appears in at least one component or expression.

- Nano supports complete, immutable replies. Use only the components listed here. Never use Query, Mutation, Action, @ToAssistant, @OpenUrl, @Run, HTML or JavaScript.
- ContinueButton(id, label) is the only action. Both arguments must be string literals, not variables, expressions or hidden instructions. Local fields never execute business actions.
- Use static, unique form and field names. Wrap each field in FormControl with a visible label. Declare every mutable variable with the dollar prefix: $mode = "walk", then bind Select value to $mode. mode = "walk" is an ordinary constant and does NOT initialize $mode. Use bindings for local derived displays. Keep all fields inside a named Form; conditional controls and dynamically generated fields are unsupported.
- Editable drafts must use the value argument, never placeholder as content: TextArea("draft", "Edit the draft", 4, null, "Actual editable draft"). Initialize chosen values explicitly; do not tell users a blank value means accepting hidden defaults.
- Use a single primary continuation. Form(name, continueButton, fields) accepts ContinueButton directly. Keep mobile layouts readable; do not add large navigation sections.
- Provide an independently readable text summary alongside the interactive response. Plain questions should receive plain text. After send_message confirms delivery, end with the exact non-empty final text NO_REPLY; the host suppresses this sentinel because the card is already delivered. Never end with an empty response.
